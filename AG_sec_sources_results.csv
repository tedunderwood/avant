Nightwood;Barnes, Djuna;mdp.49015000561713;1937;1936;Friedman, Fuchs;p. 19;American;Denunciation of Western patriarchy, of its sexual mores and sociocultural expectations, as well as its forms of narrative, is reflected in Barnes's dehumanization of character. Alienated, deprived of love, or sexually confused, Nightwood's characters are drained of vitality except for sudden outbursts of grief or protest. Ortega y Gasset identifies dehumanization as a device of the avant garde, its aim to mitigate a reader's tendency to empathize, thus compelling objectivity and critical judgment 
Murphy;Beckett, Samuel;umn.31951p001743923;;1938;Marcus, Nicholls;p. 397;Irish;Editor Eugene Jolas was fascinated by the workings of the unconscious in language, and his involvement with psychoanalysis and with various forms of irrationalism made transition a receptive home for the work of writers like James Joyce and Samuel Beckett who had set their face against British tradi- tionalism.
Two Serious Ladies;Bowles, Jane Auer;mdp.39015010824095;;1943;Friedman, Fuchs;p. 20;American;"Her prose, particularly in Two Serious Ladies (1943), may be

with Herself Surprised (1941) and followed by To Be A Pilgrim (1942),

Three Soldiers;Dos Passos, John;nyp.33433082486238;;1921;Nanney;p. 128;American;In this first of his modernist novels, Dos Passos lets function dictate form: the novel’s technical structure, dependent for its significance on the relation of parts to the whole, reflects the theme of the individual’s relationship to the system he faces.

Palimpsest;H. D (Hilda Doolittle);uc1.$b56281;;1926;Gasiorek;p. 54;American;All three novelists developed innovative literary forms to explore this terra incognita, as did others in the years to come, Djuna Barnes, H.D., Mina Loy, Jean Rhys, Una Marson, May Sinclair, and Virginia Woolf among them. 
William, an Englishman;Hamilton, Cicely;uc2.ark+=13960=t7np1zm8d;1920;1919;Gasiorek;p. 53;English;We should note as well that several ‘modern’ novels – for example Elizabeth Robins’s The Convert (1907), Charlotte Despard’s and Mabel Collins’s Outlawed: A Novel on the Woman Suffrage Question (1908), Constance Maud’s No Surrender (1911), Cicely Hamilton’s William – An Englishman (1919), Virginia Woolf’s Night and Day (1919), and John Cournos’s Babel (1922) – addressed the question of the suffrage and explored the dilemmas faced by the suffragettes, even though they were not technically and formally as inventive as the texts produced by Bryher, Loy, Richardson, and the later Woolf.

Titus Groan;Peake, Mervyn Laurence;mdp.39015062110666;1967;1946;Plain;pp. 154-157;British;"Burgess goes on to suggest an absence of ‘topical themes’ (10) in the novel, arguing
that Peake creates a world that resists a ‘central sermon or warning’ (9),
but this seems a debatable conclusion, not least because the stagnant
world of Gormenghast proves singularly ill-prepared to deal with evil
and the changes it will force upon a fossilised society. Titus Groan,
then, like so much literature of this period, both bears the imprint of its
context, and seeks, through extravagant fantasy, to displace the known
world."

Revolving Lights;Richardson, Dorothy Miller;uc1.$b244474;;1923;Friedman, Fuchs;p. 89;British;"
For Richardson, neither plot nor moral tone should interpose between the author's representation of reality and the reader's apprehension of it. What is implicit is a rejection of the authoritative stance of the writer, either as the craftsman manipulating events, or as the seer who imbues his manipulations with moral value judgments.
Not only are plot and narrative unacceptable, so too is characterization (example from Revolving Light)"

To the Lighthouse;Woolf, Virginia;mdp.39015005385292;;1927;Gasiorek;p. 334;British;Joyce’s Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, Pound’s the Cantos, Richardson’s Pilgrimage, Lewis’s The Apes of God, and Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and The Waves – to take only some of the better known examples – are hardly cautious or non‐ experimental works, but they differ in significant ways from each other and some of them are clearly marked by the War, whereas others – Ulysses especially – have an oblique relationship with it.
